# Bullet Forge

Bullet Forge is a Bullet generation tool that harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through OpenAI's GPT technologies, specifically Large Language Models (LLM).

The primary objective of this tool is to streamline the process of listing accomplishments and achievements by:

1. Offloading the cognitive and administrative burden of transforming factual information into effective Bullets
2. Offering suggestions to rephrase verbs, impacts, and outcomes to enhance variety and avoid repetition throughout the document
3. Intelligently incorporating acronyms to optimize spacing and enhance the readability of Bullets, while maintaining consistency across the document

## OpenAI GPT-3 Models

The usage of the OpenAI API is documented on the [OpenAI API documentation website](https://platform.openai.com/docs) and within the Smarter Bullets server code.

The specific model used depends on the specific prompt or task required for Bullet Forging within the Smarter Bullets server. You can read more about these in the [OpenAI API models documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3).

## Fine Tuning

To run your own fine-tuning, you can use the Jupyter Notebook within the `model/` directory. Please note that the notebook can only be executed if Jupyter Notebook, python, and the OpenAI CLI tool and its dependencies have been installed on your device. It is recommended that all the above dependencies are installed within a `venv` instance using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

An example data format can be seen within this repository, but does not represent the data used to create Bullet Forge. The [OpenAI API fine-tuning documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset) can provide more details on the data preparation.

## Scraping

Much of the test data was sourced from the contributors and the contributors' peers, but more data was required to build the fine-tuning data sets for Bullet Forge. Custom Python scripts were written to perform scraping on different bullet repositories that are publicly available. Some examples of websites with open-source bullets include:

- http://www.eprbullets.com/
- http://www.eprbulletsafsc.com/
- http://www.airforcewriter.com/epr_bullets.htm
- https://www.afeprbullets.com/
- https://afbulletsafe.com/Display/Tag/EPR

You can run the scraper as part of the Jupyter Notebook series in the `model/` directory.

## API Key

The OpenAI API key is a repository secret that is used by the application in the production environment. When developing on your own, you will not have access to the fine-tuned models nor the OpenAI API account that is being used to generate Bullets.

As an individual contributor to this repository, you are not required to touch the OpenAI API fine-tuning and modelling portions of the application. If you have issues with the Bullets being generated by Bullet Forge, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Virtual Environments

A best practice for developing in Python is using a virtual environment (venv). Within the root of this directory is a `requirements.txt` file for installing the dependencies required by `python3` to run the Jupyter Notebook contents.

To properly develop locally and contribute to Bullet Forge, please follow the [repository README](../README.md), and the following Bullet Forge development-specific instructions:

1. To create the venv, execute the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. To activate the venv, execute the following:

```bash
# Windows-based OS
\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
# MacOS or UNIX-based OS
source /.venv/bin/activate
```

3. To install requirements into your venv, execute the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To record any dependency changes, execute the following:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
