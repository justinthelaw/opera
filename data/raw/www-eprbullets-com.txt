: I expect basic -Action; result--impact bullets. They don't need to conform with a particular writing guide (though I will provide it), nor do they need to be of a particular length. I also expect the member to write about one additional plain-language line per bullet that explains what they did. I should also receive sufficient quantity of bullets to roughly fill half of the form (at a minimum). I will probably write the vast majority of their EPR bullets from scratch; at the very least, the provided bullets will get a complete overhaul. The goal is to get the member used to writing bullets and doing research on work activities and impacts. Follow-up will include use of writing guides, word choice, better research/how to dig deep. "Failure": Only plain-language inputs with no attempt at bullet format, or no input.
