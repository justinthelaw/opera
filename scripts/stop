# Remove mentions of MongoDB and the database from README

The following sections and content related to MongoDB and the database will be removed from the README file:

- Background
- What are "Bullets"
- How are "Bullets" Formatted
- Example Bullets
- Bullet Forge
- Acronym List Imports
- Local Development
  - General
  - Running
  - Building
  - Testing
  - Pipelines

Why the Hard Fork section will be kept as it is not related to MongoDB or the database.

Please review and merge this PR once the changes have been verified.

Thank you!
